# Pathfinding Algorithms Visualizer

I was looking into pathfinding where I then found Dijkstra's algorithm and the A* algorithm. <br>
Inspired by Devon Crawford's A* Pathfinding Visualizer,<br>
I decided to create it with JavaScript cause I thought it would be cool to see how it works.<br>
Might do more of these algorithm visualizers in the future.
