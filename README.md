# Pathfinding Algorithms Visualizer

I was looking into the two algorithms commonly used for pathfinding,
Dijkstra's algorithm and the A* algorithm. <br>
Inspired by Devon Crawford's A* Pathfinding Visualizer,<br>
I decided to visualize it on the HTML canvas cause I thought it would be cool to see how it works.<br>
Might do more of these algorithm visualizers in the future.
